# ml-image-comparison-tool
This project utilizes several machine learning algorithms to performs comparisons between a base image set used for training and a comparison image.  AUC and MSE will be used as the primary metrics for measuring comparison.

The following Deep Learning methods are utilized for binary classification:

* CNN
* Transfer Learning with ResNet 50 and EfficientNet b0
* ViT - Vision Transformer
* Binary Classification with AutoEncoder
